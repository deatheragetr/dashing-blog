<h5>Details</h5>
<p>Thomas is an OK software engineer and mediocre designer. </p>
<p>He lives in a 1 bedroom apartment in NYC.</p>
<p>He was raised in Virginia, born in Pennsylvania and conceived in Nairobi, Kenya</p>
<p>He also has a girlfriend.</p>
<p>His current role is CTO & Co-founder of <a href="https://funder.dog/">funder.dog</a>, where he builds conversational bots to boost fundraising efforts for non-profits. Software is eating the world. Web is eating software. Bots are eating the web. Thomas usually eats his own words.</p>
<p>His design influences include <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee's</a> bio.</p>
<p>His web technology experiences include, but are not limited to: Ruby (both Rails _and_ Sinatra), Node.js, Perl, Python, React, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Meteor, and JSONAPI -- <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">the antibikeshdding tool</a></p>
<p>Interesting facts: Thomas once cost his empolyer over $15k in losses after he forgot to specify UTF-8 on a database migration script. Now he never forgets his character encodings. If one learns by failing, Thomas has learned a lot. </p>
<p>Permission is hereby granted to quote Thomas, but only without attribution because he's probaby wrong.</p>
